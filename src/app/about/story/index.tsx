            After fleeing war-torn Syria, young Ahmad and his family found
            themselves in a difficult refugee camp in Lebanon. Despite the
            challenges, Ahmad never lost hope and worked hard to learn new
            skills. After years of waiting, Ahmad and his family were granted
            asylum in the United States, where he faced new challenges but
            persevered with the help of local organizations and volunteers.
            Ahmad`s story is a reminder of the resilience of Syrian refugees. To
